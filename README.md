Final project


In this repository, you will find the code we wrote to analyze trends at Alternative Schools in North Carolina. We compared their rates of chronic absenteeism, demographic makeup, funding, and proficiency levels to those at North Carolina's traditional schools. In the zip file, you will find all of the data frames needed to run that code and two R markdown files: one focuses on cleaning data and another shows our main findings. 


We used data from The U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction and North Carolina School Report Cards. Someone wanting to expand on our findings could figure out how to include schools that we were not able to. These schools were excluded due to discrepancies in name spelling that prevented us from combining them in a "joined dataframe." 

We also created an interactive scatterplot showing the per pupil funding at Alternative Schools compared to the percentage of those funds used on instructional supplies and equipment.
